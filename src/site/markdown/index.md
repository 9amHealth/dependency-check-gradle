Dependency-Check Gradle Plugin
==============================

Dependency-Check is a utility that identifies project dependencies and checks if there are any known, publicly disclosed, vulnerabilities. This tool can be part of the solution to the OWASP Top 10 2013: A9 - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities.

The Gradle Plugin is still a work in progress. The core dependency-check functionality works; however, the configuration options available in the other plugins still need to be completed.
For more information about the plugin, including usage, please see the github repo's [readme](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/blob/master/dependency-check-gradle/README.md).
