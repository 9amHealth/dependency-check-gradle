Usage
==============================
The OWASP dependency-check-gradle plugin provides monitoring of the projects dependent
libraries; creating a report of known vulnerable components that are included in the build.

It is important to understand that the first time this task is executed it may
take 5-20 minutes as it downloads and processes the data from the National
Vulnerability Database (NVD) hosted by NIST: https://nvd.nist.gov

After the first batch download, as long as the plugin is executed at least once every
seven days the update will only take a few seconds.
